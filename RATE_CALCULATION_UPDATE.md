# Rate Calculation Update

## Overview
Updated the Python data scripts to calculate **three separate rate types** instead of just the combined rate, providing more granular analysis of price movements.

## New Rate Fields

### 1. `overnight_rate`
- **Calculation**: (Current Open - Previous Close) / Previous Close × 100
- **Represents**: Price movement from previous day's close to current day's open
- **Use case**: Captures gap ups/downs, news reactions, after-hours trading effects

### 2. `day_rate` 
- **Calculation**: (Current Close - Current Open) / Current Open × 100
- **Represents**: Intraday price movement from open to close
- **Use case**: Measures actual trading session performance

### 3. `rate` (unchanged)
- **Calculation**: (Current Close - Previous Close) / Previous Close × 100
- **Represents**: Combined daily return (close-to-close)
- **Use case**: Traditional daily return calculation, maintained for backward compatibility

## Mathematical Verification
The three rates are mathematically related by the compound interest formula:
```
Combined Rate = Overnight Rate + Day Rate + (Overnight Rate × Day Rate / 100)
```

This relationship is automatically verified by the data quality checker for every sampled entry. The compound verification ensures that:
1. Individual rate calculations are accurate
2. The compound relationship holds mathematically 
3. Floating-point precision is handled appropriately (tolerance: ±0.000002%)

**Example verification:**
- Overnight: 0.212568%, Day: 0.718727% 
- Expected Combined: 0.212568 + 0.718727 + (0.212568 × 0.718727 / 100) = 0.932823%
- Actual Combined: 0.932823% ✅

## Updated Files

### 1. `daily_update.py`
- Updated `get_latest_data_twelvedata()` to include new rate fields in data structure
- Enhanced `calculate_metrics()` to compute all three rate types
- Added backward compatibility for existing data files

### 2. `download_complete_data.py`
- Updated all data creation functions to include new rate fields
- Enhanced `merge_and_calculate()` to compute all three rates
- Updated TQQQ simulation to apply 3x leverage to all rate types
- Updated TQQQ adjustment function to preserve all rate fields

### 3. `check_data_quality.py`
- Enhanced `check_rate_calculations()` to verify all three rate types
- **Added compound relationship verification**: `rate = overnight_rate + day_rate + (overnight_rate × day_rate / 100)`
- Updated precision analysis to consider all rate fields
- Improved error reporting to show which rate calculation failed
- Enhanced tolerance handling for floating-point precision edge cases

## Example Data Structure
```json
{
  "2025-08-08": {
    "open": 570.45001,
    "close": 574.54999,
    "overnight_rate": 0.212568,
    "day_rate": 0.718727,
    "rate": 0.932823,
    "sma200": 511.65185
  }
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ All rate calculations have been verified mathematically
- ✅ Data quality checker shows perfect results for all sampled calculations
- ✅ Both QQQ and TQQQ datasets updated successfully with 5000+ trading days
- ✅ Mathematical relationships verified: `Combined = Overnight + Day + (Overnight × Day / 100)`
- ✅ Compound verification integrated into data quality checker
- ✅ Daily update script fixed to handle "no new data" scenarios gracefully
- ✅ All extreme value cases verified for calculation accuracy
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained - all existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for API edge cases

## Benefits
1. **Better Analysis**: Separate overnight and intraday movements
2. **Gap Analysis**: Easy identification of overnight gaps
3. **Trading Strategy**: Different strategies for overnight vs intraday movements
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `rate` field preserved
5. **Quality Assurance**: Enhanced validation of all calculations

## Usage Example
```javascript
// Access different rate types
const overnightMove = data[date].overnight_rate;  // Gap up/down
const intradayMove = data[date].day_rate;         // Trading session
const totalMove = data[date].rate;               // Combined daily return
```
